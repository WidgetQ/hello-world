Experimental initial repository to set up GitHub

I have set up this environment to enable some experimentation with the IBM Q facility over time.
I have worked within the SaaS solutions industry for many years, but in most of the last 20 looking after companies, rather than as a technical expert. It's quite alot of years since I developed in C++ etc. with a CompSci background! 
But, a bit of practical experience can only help your research...WidgetQ
